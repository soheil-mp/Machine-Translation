# Machine Translation
Machine Translation (MT) is the task of automatically converting one natural language into another, preserving the meaning of the input text, and producing fluent text in the output language. While machine translation is one of the oldest subfields of artificial intelligence research, the recent shift towards large-scale empirical techniques has led to very significant improvements in translation quality.
